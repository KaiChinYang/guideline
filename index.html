  <br />
  <div>Ｎotice: Our system needs a virtual MIDI port to MIDI out back to our system to demonstrate how to play the

  <div>Step2: Press the right mouse button. The console will show all MIDI inputs/outputs of your device. Please check
    your inputs[0] and outputs[0] must be the virtual MIDI port. </div>
  <div>If you have your virtual MIDI port, please turn off
    other MIDI ports or stop other MIDI devices in order to let the virtual MIDI port be inputs[0]/outputs[0] </div>
  <div>Step3: The MIDI key board should be the inputs[1]/outputs[1].</div>
